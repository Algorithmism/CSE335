This directory is for the copying of projects to save the data. If you'd like to run the files, please place them back in the parent directory 'repos':

Do NOT delete or overwrite the folder called Step2. Instead, rename the Step2 folder in repos directory to 'Step2Copy'. Place 'Step2Copy' into the Copies directory.
Same with all other projects.

ONLY THEN shall you place projects back into the repos directory.
